### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2022

+ Projec title: Based on the philosophy belief, how does people feel about the world?
+ This project is conducted by Yixuan Zhang

+ Project summary: [a short summary] As a human being, we may often ask ourselves the question -- "What kind of person am I?" Throughout our lives, we may always on the way to learn more about ourselves and others. However, the belief is intangible and unmeasurable, but with the help of modern data analysis tools, we may form some ideas to the former question by conducting experiements forcusing on people's sentiments and emotions. In this project, I will use the data from The Philosophy Data Project (http://philosophydata.com/index.html), which contains 51 philosophical texts spanning 13 core schools of philosophy, including Rationalism, Empiricism, Capitalism, etc. My goal is to see what sentiments and emotions are people tend to have in each school of philosophy. Hopefully, it can help us understand the core beliefs of people in the modern era including ourselves.
